Essay Text:

Introduction: What, Why, How.

Selected Ambient Works 85-92 was released with Apollo Records – A subsidiary of R&S – on November
9th, 1992. The album represents the debut of Richard D. James under the pseudonym Aphex Twin,
although it was not his first foray into published music, with the EP Analogue Bubblebath released the
year prior through Mighty Force Records, and the EP Didgeridoo with R&S only a month before Ambient
Works, to much acclaim in the underground.
The record entered the dance charts at no.6 on the 26th of December 1992, and developed “a huge
underground reputation” according to Jon Savage in 1993 – however, this underground status is now
distant, with Ambient Works featuring at the number one spot on Pitchfork’s 50 Best IDM Albums of All
Time, and representing the popular starting point of the monolith that is Aphex Twin in modern electronic
music.
In this essay, I will examine the impact and legacy of The Aphex Twin’s Ambient Works 85-92 from the
perspective of a contemporary electronic musician, as well as looking at the cultural, social, and
technological context of the record’s release to prove that this work represents a foundational cornerstone
of IDM and ambient techno.

Main Body: Production, Context, Legacy and Impact.

Production:

Analysing the production of this record with more than 30 years of releases and technological
developments is a fascinating task. The technical context differs broadly from that of the contemporary
digital producer, even on the base level of the recording medium – each of these tracks has pulled from a
large collection of cassette tapes, from around 7 years of constant musical creation on James’ part; this
fact can easily be heard in the consistent artefacting, pops, dropouts, and tape hiss present in each track to
varying degrees – from the perspective of fidelity, the treatment of the tapes has not been kind, but this
damage has lent the recordings a quality that perfectly suits the nostalgic ear; in fact, James himself
commented on the damage to the tape on Xtal in a profile from Future Music in ‘93: “With the first track
[Xtal on Ambient Works] the tape had chewed in about seven places... it would have been easy to edit out
the glitches digitally, but it’s a retrospective look, and the tape munching was all part of the stuff I was
doing, so I’ve left it in.”

Another interesting point from the same article is James’ opinion on the classic Roland TR-808 drum
sounds used on much of the album “I don’t want to use pre-programmed drum sounds. I’ve used modified
[Roland TR-]808 sounds on Ambient Works, but that’s because the tracks are around four to five years
old.” In my critical opinion, the 808 sounds are easily the most poorly aged element of the album, feeling
dated in their simplicity and lack of processing – the drum tracks on Ageispolis, for example, feel
painfully dry in comparison to the richer textures of James’ drum parts in works after Ambient Works.

A particular contextual difference from most contemporary producers is James’ access and approach to music hardware
– where the modern electronic artist has a range of uniform, off the shelf tools (and crucially, these are
software tools) to recreate or innovate in any way that might want, an artist in the late 80s and early 90s
was limited by what they were able to find in local stores or order from magazines. In James’ case, this
encouraged a great deal of customisation at the electronic hardware level, indeed leaving very little of his
hardware unmodified: “The only keyboard I haven’t changed is the Korg MS20.” 
In this way, James shows a preference for the Buchla practice of electronic synthesis, rather than the Moog; a shift away 
from the keyboard and the direct human interface. Indeed, he is quoted 

Context:

With the advent of “Electronic Listening Music” (which later became known by the dubiously accurate
term Intelligent Dance Music, or IDM) in the early ‘90s, an album of quiet, accessible ambient techno
tracks was a niche that Ambient Works filled perfectly – also benefitting from the concurrent trend for
“chill-out” music, a supplement to the fatiguing intensity of acid and hardcore.
Neil Mason, editor for the magazine Electronic Sound is quoted in The Independent: “The thing about
Selected Ambient Works 85-92 is that it arrived at exactly the right time. The acid house explosion of
1988 had ushered in an entirely new genre of music, but by 1992 it was beginning to settle, and this sort
of music was starting to cross over.”
